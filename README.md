### What it does:

This is a Java command line program. It is a calculator that computes operations like:

The user is asked to enter an expression, the program displays the answer, then asks to enter an option. The options are:
- 'm', to record the last result in the memory
- 'mr', to display the result recorded in the memory
- 'c', to clear the memory
- 'h', to display all the previous results since compiling the program.</br>
The user can also type [sign number], that will use the memory stored number, and the program will display the result. The program will run until the user will enter 'EXIT'.
